# Intuition
Just think of simple math concept of school days ...
when do you say given sides a,b,c form a traingle ?


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The sum of the length of the two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. 
1. let 3 sides be a,b,c
2. sort them to get c,a,b
3. traverse the array from reverse and check if c < a + b
4. if so, return a+b+c
5. else return 0
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)-1,1,-1):
            if(nums[i] < nums[i-1] + nums[i-2]):
                return nums[i] + nums[i-1] + nums[i-2]

        return 0
```
Got intuition from Ashutosh Pandey !
