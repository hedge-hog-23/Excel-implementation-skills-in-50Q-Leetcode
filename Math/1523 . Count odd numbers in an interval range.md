# Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

## Intuition
When solving this problem, trying a brute-force approach will result in a **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** error for large inputs. To optimize, take a pen and paper and analyze all four possible test cases:

- Odd `low` and Odd `high`
- Odd `low` and Even `high`
- Even `low` and Odd `high`
- Even `low` and Even `high`

By working these out, you'll notice the solution becomes straightforward.

If you still have difficulty, refer to the solution below!

## Approach
The approach is based on the parity (odd/even nature) of the `low` and `high` values. Depending on their parity, the number of odd numbers in the interval is calculated using integer division and conditional checks.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  The solution involves constant-time arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`  
  No additional data structures are used.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def countOdds(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        if low % 2 != 0 and high % 2 != 0:
            return (high - low) // 2 + 1
        elif low % 2 == 0 and high % 2 == 0:
            return (high - low) // 2
        elif low % 2 != 0 and high % 2 == 0:
            return 1 + (high - low) // 2
        else:
            return (high - low) // 2 + 1
