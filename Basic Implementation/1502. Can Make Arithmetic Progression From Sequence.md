# Intuition
What does AP mean ??
Same Difference across the series ??

# Approach
1. **Sort the array** to ensure elements are in order.  
2. **Check edge case**: If the array has one element, return `True`.  
3. **Compute common difference** from the first two elements.  
4. **Iterate and compare differences**, returning `False` if any mismatch.  
5. **Return `True`** if all differences match.  


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(nlogn)$$ (as we used .sort())

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def canMakeArithmeticProgression(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        arr.sort()
        if(len(arr) == 1):
            return True
        
        diff = arr[1]-arr[0]
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            if arr[i] - arr[i-1] != diff:
                return False
        
        return True


```
