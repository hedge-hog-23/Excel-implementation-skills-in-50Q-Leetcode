# Intuition
Can we solve this using Bit Manipulation ??
XoR may be ?? Think it off.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Create an int variable and assign `res=0`.
2. Traverse the 1st string `s` and find XOR of all elements using ord and store in res.
3. Trverse the string`t` similarly and find the XoR for elements here too.
4. Return the res as `chr`.
 
EX => S = "ABCD", T = "ABCDE"
  - ASCII value of them are 97,98,99,100 and 101
  - now finding xor of them all the repeating elements in s and t will turn to 0 leaving the 1 extra character's ASCII value in res.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        res = 0

        for i in s:
            res =  res ^ ord(i)
        for i in t:
            res = res ^ ord(i)

        return chr(res)
        
```
