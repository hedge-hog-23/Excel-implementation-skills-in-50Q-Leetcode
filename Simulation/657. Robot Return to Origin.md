# Approach 1 (regular approach)
- Initial pt - x,y= 0,0
- Traverse the string and Use else if ladder - 4 conditions :
  1. if direction = 'U' -> x+=1
  2. if direction = 'D' -> x-=1
  3. if direction = 'R' -> y+=1
  4. else -> y-=1
- Check if x == 0 and y == 0, then return *True* else *False* 

# Approach 2 (faster approach)
- Just use .count() method to count freq of U,D,R and L
- Check if count of R == L and U == D and return True
- This is much faster because count method is implemented using C in python.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code

```python3(approach1) []
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        x,y = 0,0
        for i in moves:
            if i == 'U':
                x+=1
            elif i == 'D':
                x-=1
            elif i == 'R':
                y+=1
            else:
                y-=1
        return (x == 0 and y == 0)
```
```python3(approach2) []
class Solution:
    def judgeCircle(self, moves: str) -> bool:
        return moves.count('L') == moves.count('R') and moves.count('U') == moves.count('D')
