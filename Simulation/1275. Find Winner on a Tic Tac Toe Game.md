# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Create a 3x3 Grid with empty strings (''), representing an empty board. Fill the Board

2. As we iterate through the moves, we place 'A' (for Player A) and 'B' (for Player B) alternately in the grid.
3. Check for a Winner

    We define three functions:
    -checkrow(): Checks if any row has all the same non-empty symbols.
    -checkcol(): Checks if any column has the same symbols.
    -checkdia(): Checks the two diagonals for a winner.

If any function returns 'A' or 'B', that player wins.
Determine the Result

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

        winner = checkrow(game) or checkcol(game) or checkdia(game)
        if winner:
